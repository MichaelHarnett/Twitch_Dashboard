Once again using my love of video games to drive my choice on data, I have decided to use Twitch (the number one game streaming service). In using thei API, I hope to create a current dashboard, showing the number of streamers vs. the nubmer of users. Ideally this can be broken down by genre, game, gender, or into any other denomination of users. Game streaming is gaining popularity quickly. The idea is that this dashboard can be used as a tool to help budding streamers know their market. Who else is streaming right now, when their content is most likely to be watched, and when they should wait.


## Data
The data for this project will come from Twitch's API, dev.twitch.tv



## Tools
